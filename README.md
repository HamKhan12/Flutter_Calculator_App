   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     math_expressions: ^latest_version
   Run flutter pub get to install dependencies
4. Connect a device or emulator and run flutter run

##Usage

1. Tap number buttons to enter values
2. Use operation buttons (+, -, ร, รท) to perform calculations
3. Press '=' to evaluate the expression
4. Use 'AC' to clear all inputs or 'DEL' to remove the last character
